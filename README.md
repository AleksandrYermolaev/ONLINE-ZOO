# Online-zoo

Online-zoo is a platform that collects information about animals from various zoos with webcams. It is assumed that the user can open a page with zoo resources, watch one of the animals, or make a donation that will be used to purchase food. As part of the task, an adaptive layout and interactivity of the main page and the page with donations were made.
